		<h1>Design Preview</h1>

		<p class="intro">The second round of design and revisions have been collected in a single click-through presentation. The table of contents below shows how the 9 frames are organized.</p>

		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The presentation starts with the homepage, then transitions into sample interior layout concepts, before ending with a block style and specialty style showcase</p>

		<p><strong>Navigating the Click-through: </strong> Each frame includes notes in the bottom right corner. If you see <span style="color: #333;font-weight: 500;">dark-gray&nbsp;edges</span> on the left, right, top and bottom sides of the design, reduce your browser window size until they are just out of view. Clicking anywhere on the image itself, or using the links within the notes section will allow you to progress to the next frame in the presentation.</p>

		<p><strong>Please review and discuss the designs as a team prior to our next session.</strong> We will review your click-through and make revisions in Photoshop together during the session. It is important to have all key decision makers present or have gathered their feedback if they can not attend the session.</p>
