		<h2>About this Frame + Sample Layout | Wide Left, Skinny Right</h2>
		<div class="noteInner">

			<div class="noteDesc"> 

				<p>Provided with this design are three sample interior pages that showcase how one may layout a page. They vary in scope and style but are meant to showcase how different typica pages on a school website are laid out.</p>
				<p>The second layout is aptly named the "Wide Left, Skinny Right" layout and is by far one of the most common layout schemes across websites. Great for pages whose content, while important, doesn't need to be as engaging as a landing page or other pages, such as Letters from Headmaster, simple walkthroughs.</p>
